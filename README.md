### Thorax Disease Classification using CNNs
A simple CNN based model designed to identify class of thorax diseases from the given chest x-ray images, an image can be classified in one 14 classes.

### Naive Bayes Model
Implementation for Simple Naive Bayes is done which works on 3 features Age, Gender, View Position of X-ray giving Acuuracy - 14%.

### CNN Model
The current CNN approach with initial weights of pre-trained VGG model gives an accuracy of 17.30% after 30 epochs, with a steady increase in accuracy after each epoch. I intend to try few other variations of my own models to achieve a better accuracy.  This is by no means my final code.
